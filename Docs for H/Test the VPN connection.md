Testing the VPN connection is an important step in the process of configuring remote access to the ጊዜ instance. By testing the connection, you can ensure that remote users are able to connect to the VPN server and access the ጊዜ application successfully. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to test the VPN connection:

1.  Connect to the VPN using a remote client: Have a remote user install an OpenVPN client on their device and provide them with the client configuration files and certificates that you have created earlier. Have the user use the OpenVPN client to connect to the VPN server by specifying the server's IP address or hostname, the port number, and the client configuration files.
    
2.  Check the server logs for a successful connection: Log in to the OpenVPN server and check the server logs for a successful connection from the remote client. You can use the command 
	```
	sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog" or "sudo tail -f /var/log/openvpn.log" to check the openvpn logs
	```
    
3.  Check the client's IP address: Once the remote user is connected to the VPN, use the command ```
```
ifconfig
```
on the client's device or the command ```
```
ip addr show
```
to check the client's IP address. The IP address should be the same as the internal IP address of the VM running ጊዜ.
    
4.  Test access to the ጊዜ application: Have the remote user try to access the ጊዜ application using a web browser by going to the URL http://<server-ip>/ጊዜ. If the user is able to access the application and navigate through it, then the VPN connection is working correctly.

5.  Test the connection from different clients: Repeat the process by testing the connection from different clients with different operating systems or configurations to ensure that the VPN is working correctly for all users.
    
6.  Test the access to other resources on the network: Check if the client can access other resources on the network such as file servers, printers and other devices that are required to run the ጊዜ.
    

	By following these steps, you should be able to test the VPN connection and confirm that remote users are able to connect to the VPN server and access the ጊዜ application successfully. This will confirm that the VPN configuration is complete and that the remote access to the ጊዜ instance is working correctly. It is important to monitor the VPN connection and log to ensure the stability and security.
