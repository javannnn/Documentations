1.  Create a client configuration directory: You will need to create a directory to store the client configuration files. This directory can be located anywhere on the system, for example, you can create the directory at `/etc/openvpn/client-configs` by running the following command:
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/openvpn/client-configs
```
2.  Create a client configuration file: For each client that needs to connect to the VPN, you will need to create a client configuration file. You can create a sample file named `client.conf` in the `/etc/openvpn/client-configs` directory by running this command:
```
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/client-configs/client.conf
```
3.  Specify the server information: In the client configuration file, you will need to specify the IP address or hostname of the VPN server, and the port number that the server is listening on. For example, you can add the following line to specify the server information:
```
remote <VPN-server-ip-or-hostname> <port>
```
4.  Specify the encryption settings: In the client configuration file, you will need to specify the encryption settings that should be used when connecting to the VPN server. This should match the encryption settings that are configured on the server. You can add the following line to specify the encryption settings: 
```
proto <protocol>
```
replace <protocol> with udp or tcp and by default, OpenVPN uses AES-256-CBC encryption

5.  Specify the location of the client certificate and key files: In the client configuration file, you will also need to specify the location of the client's certificate and key files. You can add the following lines to specify the location of the files:
```
cert /path/to/client.crt
key /path/to/client.key
```
6.  Specify the location of the CA certificate: Finally, you will need to specify the location of the CA certificate in the client configuration file. This can be done by adding the following line:
```
ca /path/to/ca.crt
```
7.  Repeat steps 2-6 for each client: Repeat the process for each additional client that needs to connect to the VPN server. Each client will need their own unique client configuration file and certificate/key pair
    
8.  Distribute the client configuration files and certificates: Once the client configuration files and certificates are set up, you will need to distribute them to the clients. This can be done through various methods such as email, file server, or USB drive.
    

Once this is done, you should have successfully set up the client configuration and provided the client with the necessary files to establish a connection to the VPN server. You should make sure that the client use the same encryption settings on the client side as in the server side and and also ensure that the client's firewall allows traffic to the VPN port and that the client is connected to the internet. In addition, you should keep in mind that the client's certificates and keys should be protected and only distributed to authorized users. Finally, it is important to regularly check the connections of the client and the status of the VPN server. This will ensure that the VPN is running smoothly and that any problems can be addressed promptly.
