Here are the general steps to ensure that the DHCP reservation for the VM does not conflict with any other IP addresses on your network, and that the IP address you choose is inside the DHCP pool defined by the DHCP server:

1.  Check the DHCP Server configuration: Verify the DHCP server's current configuration to ensure that the IP address you are planning to assign to the VM is not already in use by another device on your network. Also, check the DHCP pool range defined by the DHCP server, to ensure that the IP address you choose for the VM is inside the DHCP pool.
    
2.  Check for Static IP addresses: In addition to checking the DHCP server's current configuration, you should also check for any static IP addresses that have been manually assigned to other devices on your network. This will help you to avoid conflicts and ensure that the IP address you choose for the VM is not already in use by another device.
    
3.  Verify Network topology: Reviewing your network topology also helps you to identify any potential conflicts, such as if you have multiple DHCP servers running on different subnets and could cause IP address conflicts.
    
4.  Use Network scanning tools: You can also use network scanning tools such as nmap, Angry IP Scanner, or Fing to check for any IP address conflicts on your network. These tools will scan your network and report any IP addresses that are already in use.
    
5.  Utilize DHCP server logs: Make sure to monitor DHCP server logs and check if there are any requests for the IP address you want to assign, if you see any request for it, it means that IP address is already in use.
    

By taking these steps, you can help ensure that the DHCP reservation for the VM does not conflict with any other IP addresses on your network and that the IP address you choose is inside the DHCP pool defined by the DHCP server. Additionally, you should also keep monitoring your DHCP configuration and network regularly to detect and resolve any IP address conflicts as soon as possible.
